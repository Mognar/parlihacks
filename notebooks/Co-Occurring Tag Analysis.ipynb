      "That this House notes the decision to leave the EU made in the referendum held on 23 June 2016; further notes that this decision did not call for the UK to leave the Single European Market and the Conservative Party manifesto commitment to safeguard British interests in the Single Market; notes that the Prime Minister does not intend to offer the House a vote on the strategic priorities to be pursued in the UK's negotiations with the EU or on whether to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty; duly notes the consequential impact on the value of the pound, the concerns expressed by the UK's business partners for the prospects for the UK economy and HM Treasury's estimate of the long-term cost of Hard Brexit; and calls on the Government to reverse its decision not to offer the House a vote on the strategic priorities to be pursued in the UK's negotiations with the EU and to seek a democratic mandate for the outcome of that negotiation by vote of the House. => EU law and treaties\n",
